# Deep Illuminator 

Deep Illuminator is a data augmentation tool designed for image relighting. It can be used to easily and efficiently generate a wide range of illumination variants of a single image. It has been tested with several datasets and models and has been shown to succesfully improve performance. 
It has a built in visualizer created with [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) to preview how the target image can be relit. 

## Example Augmentations

## Usage
The simplest method to use this tool is through Docker Hub:

```
docker pull kartvel/deep-illuminator
```
#### Visualizer
Once you have the Deep Illuminator image run the following command to launch the visualizer: 

```
docker run -it --rm  --gpus all \
-p 8501:8501 --entrypoint streamlit \ 
kartvel/deep-illuminator run streamlit/streamlit_app.py
```
You will be able to interact with it on `localhost:8501`. 
Note: If you do not have NVIDIA gpu support enabled for docker simply remove the `--gpus all` option.

#### Generating Variants
It is possible to quickly generate multiple variants for images contained in a directory by using the following command:
```
docker run -it --rm --gpus all \                                                                                               ─╯
-v /path/to/input/images:/app/probe_relighting/originals \
-v /path/to/save/directory:/app/probe_relighting/output \
kartvel/deep-illuminator --[options]
```

#### Options

| Option  | Values |  Description  |  
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| mode   | ['synthetic', 'mid'] | Selecting the style of probes used as a relighting guide.| 
| step   | int | Increment for the granularity of relighted images. max mid: 24, max synthetic: 360|
